    NOTES

    Note 1
        * 8 because 100% is a max of 4 chars, 2 pipes, 1 space, and the /
        * len(str(total)) * 2 because if len is 1000 for example, then bar
            would say 1000/10000 when completed
        * The plus 25 is just extra space to get it to align with the display
            of the actual tqdm function. That extra space is because tqdm
            also displays timestamps and iterations/second rate but we dont.
